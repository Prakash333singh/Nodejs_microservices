- as a collection of small independent and loosely coupled services
- each service focus on a single feature
  -can be developed and deployed independely
  -faster dveelopment
  -better fault isolation
  -can use different programing language for each service

rabbitmq it is software used to communicate two microserverces.
es mai hum data ko queue mai daal dete hai aur consumer data ko consume karta hai
understand the message queue
use message queue to communicate b/w microservices

## order service

like this is order service(producer-service data ko store kar rha queue mai )
queue - data insert in queue { userId ,productName,orderId ,price}
message will remain in queue until any other service used this data.
